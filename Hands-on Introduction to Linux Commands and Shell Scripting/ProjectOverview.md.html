    <h1>Linux Commands and Shell Scripting - Final Project</h1>
    <p>Estimated time needed: <strong>90</strong> minutes</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Congratulations!! You have finished the modules. Now is the time to put your skills to test. Read through the scenario below.</p>
    <p>This lab may use some bash concepts we haven't yet covered in this course. Whenever this happens, we will provide sufficient hints and/or the code for you.</p>
    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>You are a lead linux developer at the top-tech company "ABC International INC." ABC currently suffers from a huge bottleneck - each day, interns must painstakingly access encrypted password files on core servers, and backup those that were updated within the last 24-hours. This introduces human error, lowers security, and takes an unreasonable amount of work.</p>
    <p>As ABC INC's most trusted linux developer, you have been tasked with creating a script <code>backup.sh</code> which automatically backs up any of these files that have been updated within the past 24 hours.</p>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The objective of this lab is to incorporate much of the shell scripting you've learned over this course into a single script.</li>
      <li>You will schedule your shell script to run every 24 hours using <code>crontab</code>.</li>
      <li>TIP: If you're unsure whether some of your code will work as wanted, you can try the command directly in the terminal - and even create your own test scripts!</li>
    </ul>
